# Vesper

Vesper is a note-taking app for iOS by Q Branch.

This is presented as historical artifact rather than as living project. I donâ€™t expect to make any further code changes.

For more notes, see [Vesper Open Source #3: the iOS App](http://inessential.com/2016/12/21/vesper_open_source_3_the_ios_app).

I intend to take the current implementation, port it over to Swift 3 and try and update it to fit with a newer codebase of iOS10+ etc.
